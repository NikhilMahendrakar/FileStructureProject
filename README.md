# Sorting Algorithm Analysis

This Java application analyzes and compares the performance of various sorting algorithms, including Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort. The application allows users to upload a file containing data or manually input data for analysis.

## Introduction

Sorting Algorithm Analysis is a Java application designed to compare the performance of different sorting algorithms. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to upload data files or manually input data, sort the data using various algorithms, and display the time taken by each algorithm to sort the data.

## Features

- **Upload Data File**: Allows users to upload a file containing data for sorting.
- **Manual Data Input**: Provides an interface for users to manually input data.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implements and analyzes the performance of Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.
- **Performance Analysis**: Displays the time taken by each sorting algorithm to sort the data.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sorting-algorithm-analysis.git
    cd sorting-algorithm-analysis
    ```

2. **Open the project**: Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

3. **Compile and run**: Compile and run the project using your IDE.

## Usage

### Upload Data File

1. Click the "Upload" button on the main screen.
2. Select a file containing the data to be sorted.
3. The selected file will be used for sorting and analysis.

### Manual Data Input

1. Click the "Upload Manually" button on the main screen.
2. Enter the data in the provided fields and click "Insert".
3. Click "Submit" to use the manually entered data for sorting and analysis.

### Sorting and Analysis

1. Click the button corresponding to the sorting algorithm you want to use (e.g., "Insertion Sort", "Selection Sort").
2. The application will sort the data using the selected algorithm and display the time taken for sorting.
3. Click the "Analysis" button to view a comparison of the time taken by all sorting algorithms.
